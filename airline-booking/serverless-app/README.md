## AWS Serverless Airline Booking - Backend

Serverless Airline Booking backend provides Flight Search, Payment, Booking and Loyalty points APIs with GraphQL and REST endpoints. This is a serverless backend architecture using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, AppSync, DynamoDB, and Step Functions.

## Stack

Summary of the backend stack architecture:

* **Data** - All data is modeled after GraphQL types and stored in DynamoDB. Python is the core language for most services except Loyalty which is written in TypeScript.
* **API** - GraphQL is managed by AppSync and also acts as an API Hub to interact with other services. Loyalty implements a REST API to demonstrate how to secure service-to-service communication while maintaining a public endpoint. Payment API is also based on REST to demonstrate an external payment provider.
* **Auth** - Cognito provides JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and along with AppSync fine-grained authorization on what data types users can access.
* **Messaging** - Booking workflow is managed by Step Functions while SNS provides service-to-service communication through messaging between Booking and Loyalty.
